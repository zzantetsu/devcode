## ✨ What is Cloudflare VibeSDK?

Cloudflare VibeSDK is an open source AI vibe coding platform built on Cloudflare's developer platform. If you're building an AI-powered platform for building applications, this is a great example that you can deploy and customize to build the whole platform yourself. Once the platform is deployed, users can say what they want to build in natural language, and the AI agent will create and deploy the application.

Once you click "Deploy to Cloudflare", you'll be taken to your Cloudflare dashboard where you can configure your VibeSDK deployment with these variables. 

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk)

### 🔑 What you'll configure

- `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key for Gemini models
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secure random string for session management
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook authentication secret
- `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Encryption key for secrets
- `SANDBOX_INSTANCE_TYPE` - Container performance tier (optional, see section below)
- `ALLOWED_EMAIL` - Email address of the user allowed to use the app. This is used to verify the user's identity and prevent unauthorized access.
- `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` - Custom domain for your app that you have configured in Cloudflare (**Required**). This is needed for the app to work.

### 🏗️ Sandbox Instance Configuration (Optional)

VibeSDK uses Cloudflare Containers to run generated applications in isolated environments. You can configure the container performance tier based on your needs and Cloudflare plan.

#### Available Instance Types

| Instance Type | Memory | CPU | Disk | Use Case | Availability |
|---------------|--------|-----|------|----------|--------------|
| `dev` | 256 MiB | 1/16 vCPU | 2 GB | Development/testing | All plans |
| `basic` | 1 GiB | 1/4 vCPU | 4 GB | Light applications | All plans |
| `standard` | 4 GiB | 1/2 vCPU | 4 GB | Most applications | All plans (**Default**) |
| `enhanced` | 4 GiB | 4 vCPUs | 10 GB | High-performance apps | Enterprise customers only |

#### Configuration Options

**Option A: Via Deploy Button (Recommended)**
During the "Deploy to Cloudflare" flow, you can set the instance type as a **build variable**:
- Variable name: `SANDBOX_INSTANCE_TYPE`
- Recommended values:
  - **Standard/Paid users**: `standard` (default)
  - **Enterprise customers**: `enhanced`

**Option B: Via Environment Variable**
For local deployment or CI/CD, set the environment variable:
```bash
export SANDBOX_INSTANCE_TYPE=standard  # or enhanced, basic, dev
bun run deploy
```

#### Instance Type Selection Guide

**For Standard/Paid Users:**
- **`standard`** (Recommended) - Best balance of performance and resource usage
- **`basic`** - For simple applications or testing
- **`dev`** - Minimal resources for development only

**For Enterprise Customers:**
- **`enhanced`** (Recommended) - Maximum performance with full CPU cores and extra disk space
- **`standard`** - If you prefer conservative resource usage

#### What This Affects

The `SANDBOX_INSTANCE_TYPE` controls:
- **App Preview Performance** - How fast generated applications run during development
- **Build Process Speed** - Container compile and build times
- **Concurrent App Capacity** - How many apps can run simultaneously
- **Resource Availability** - Memory and disk space for complex applications

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Start with `standard` and upgrade to `enhanced` if you notice performance issues with complex applications or need faster build times.

> **⚠️ Enterprise Required**: The `enhanced` instance type requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan. Using it on other plans may result in deployment failures.

### 🔗 Post-Deployment: OAuth Setup (Optional)

OAuth configuration is **not** shown on the initial deploy page. If you want user login features, you'll need to set this up after deployment:

**How to Add OAuth After Deployment:**
1. **Find your repository** in your GitHub/GitLab account (created by "Deploy to Cloudflare" flow) 
2. **Clone locally** and run `bun install`
3. **Create `.dev.vars` and `.prod.vars` files** (see below for OAuth configuration)
4. **Run `bun run deploy`** to update your deployment

**Google OAuth Setup:**
1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) → Create Project
2. Enable **Google+ API** 
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. Add authorized origins: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev`
5. Add redirect URI: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/api/auth/google/callback`
6. Add to **both** `.dev.vars` (for local development) and `.prod.vars` (for deployment):
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
   ```

**GitHub OAuth Setup:**
1. GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **OAuth Apps**
2. Click **New OAuth App**
3. Application name: `Cloudflare VibeSDK`
4. Homepage URL: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev`
5. Authorization callback URL: `https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/api/auth/github/callback`
6. Add to **both** `.dev.vars` (for local development) and `.prod.vars` (for deployment):
   ```bash
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your-github-client-id"
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"
   ```

## 🌍 Architecture Deep Dive

### Durable Objects for Stateful AI Agents
```typescript
class CodeGeneratorAgent extends DurableObject {
  async generateCode(prompt: string) {
    // Persistent state across WebSocket connections
    // Phase-wise generation with error recovery
    // Real-time progress streaming to frontend
  }
}
```

### Workers for Platforms Deployment
```javascript
// Generated apps deployed to dispatch namespace
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const appId = extractAppId(request);
    const userApp = env.DISPATCHER.get(appId);
    return await userApp.fetch(request);
  }
};
```

### Iteration-based Code Generation
Cloudflare VibeSDK generates apps in intelligent phases:

1. **Planning Phase**: Analyzes requirements, creates file structure
2. **Foundation Phase**: Generates package.json, basic setup files  
3. **Core Phase**: Creates main components and logic
4. **Styling Phase**: Adds CSS and visual design
5. **Integration Phase**: Connects APIs and external services
6. **Optimization Phase**: Performance improvements and error fixes

## 🏠 Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and Bun
- Cloudflare account with Workers paid plan

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone your repository (or this repo)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-vibe-sdk-fork.git
cd your-vibe-sdk-fork
bun install

# Set up local database
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate:local
```

### Environment Configuration

**For Local Development (.dev.vars):**
```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars with your API keys and tokens
```

**For Production Deployment (.prod.vars):**
```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .prod.vars  
# Edit .prod.vars with your production API keys and tokens
```

> **Important**: Local development uses `.dev.vars`, but `bun run deploy` only reads from `.prod.vars` for deployment secrets.

### Deploy to Cloudflare
```bash
bun run deploy  # Builds and deploys automatically (includes remote DB migration)
```

---

### Manually Deploying the Platform

#### For Local Development (.dev.vars)
1. Copy the example file: `cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars`
2. Fill in your API keys and tokens
3. Leave optional values as `"default"` if not needed

#### For Production Deployment
1. **Build Variables**: Set in your deployment platform (GitHub Actions, etc.)
2. **Worker Secrets**: Automatically handled by deployment script or set manually:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   wrangler secret put GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY
   # ... etc
   ```

#### Environment Variable Priority
The deployment system follows this priority order:
1. **Environment Variables** (highest priority)
2. **wrangler.jsonc vars**
3. **Default values** (lowest priority)

Example: If `MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES` is set both as an environment variable (`export MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES=5`) and in wrangler.jsonc (`"MAX_SANDBOX_INSTANCES": "2"`), the environment variable value (`5`) will be used.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Deploy Issues

**🚫 "Insufficient Permissions" Error**
- Authentication is handled automatically during deployment
- If you see this error, try redeploying - permissions are auto-granted
- Contact Cloudflare support if the issue persists

**🤖 "AI Gateway Authentication Failed"**  
- Confirm AI Gateway is set to **Authenticated** mode
- Verify the authentication token has **Run** permissions
- Check that gateway URL format is correct

**🗄️ "Database Migration Failed"**
- D1 resources may take time to provision automatically
- Wait a few minutes and retry - resource creation is handled automatically
- Check that your account has D1 access enabled

**🔐 "Missing Required Variables"**
- **Worker Secrets**: Verify all required secrets are set: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`
- **AI Gateway Token**: `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` should be set as BOTH build variable and worker secret
- **Environment Variables**: These are automatically loaded from wrangler.jsonc - no manual setup needed
- **Authentication**: API tokens and account IDs are automatically provided by Workers Builds

**🤖 "AI Gateway Not Found"**
- **With AI Gateway Token**: The deployment script should automatically create the gateway. Check that your token has Read, Edit, and **Run** permissions.
- **Without AI Gateway Token**: You must manually create an AI Gateway before deployment:
  1. Go to [AI Gateway Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/ai/ai-gateway)
  2. Create gateway named `vibesdk-gateway` (or your custom name)
  3. Enable authentication and create a token with **Run** permissions

**🏗️ "Container Instance Type Issues"**
- **"enhanced" fails on non-Enterprise plans**: Use `standard` instead - `enhanced` requires Cloudflare Enterprise
- **Slow app previews**: Try upgrading from `dev` or `basic` to `standard` instance type
- **Out of memory errors**: Upgrade to higher instance type or check for memory leaks in generated apps
- **Build timeouts**: Use `enhanced` instance type (Enterprise) or `standard` for faster build times
